    I am a Staff Research Scientist at <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html">Visa Research</a> where 
    I work on Cryptography and Secure Computation.  My primary research interest is the development and applications of efficient methods for computing on encrypted data.
    Most notably is the notion of being able to compute on encrypted data and the area of research known as Secure Computation:

<p>I began my career in cryptography at Oregon State University in 2015 with the goal of advancing the field of cryptography to meet real world constraints. Most notably is the notion of being able to compute on encrypted data and the area of research known as Secure Computation:</p>
<p>A group of distrusting parties wish to compute a function on their private data sets. The parties should learn the output of the function but no additional information about the data sets themselves.</p>

<p>The potential of this technology captured my imagination in 2014 during the completion of my undergraduate in Computer Science at Oregon State University. Since then I have worked on several projects in this area. Most notably has been the development of a highly optimized protocol for performing Secure Computation and advances in Private Set Intersection for both malicious and semi-honest adversaries.</p>

<p>I view my research as part of the solution to our most challenging privacy issues. In particular, when strong privacy concerns inhibit the utility of data, e.g. medical data. I am interested in overcoming this tradeoff.</p>

<p>In this paper we present SplitCommit, a portable and efficient C++ implementation of the recent additively homomorphic commmitment scheme of Frederiksen et al. [FJNT16]. We describe numerous optimizations that go into engineering such an implementation, including highly optimized general purpose bit-matrix transposition and efficient ECC encoding given the associated generator matrix. We also survey and analyze in detail the applicability of [FJNT16] and include a detailed comparison to the canonical (non-homomorphic) commitment scheme based on a Random Oracle. We include performance benchmarks of the implementation in various network setting, for instance on a 10 Gbps LAN we achieve amortized commitment and decommitment running times of 0.65μs and 0.27μs, respectively. Finally we also include an extensive tutorial on how to use the library.</p>

<p>Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a cryptographic technique that allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything except the intersection. We use fully homomorphic encryption to construct a fast PSI protocol with a small communication overhead that works particularly well when one of the two sets is much smaller than the other, and is secure against semi-honest adversaries.</p>

<p>Machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, create better predictive models when having access to larger datasets. In many domains, such as medicine and finance, each institute has only access to limited amounts of data, and creating larger datasets typically requires collaboration. However, there are privacy related constraints on these collaborations for legal, ethical, and competitive reasons. In this work, we present a feasible protocol for learning neural networks in a collaborative way while preserving the privacy of each record. This is achieved by combining Differential Privacy and Secure Multi-Party Computation with Machine Learning.</p>

      <p>Gizem S Cetin, Hao Chen, Kim Laine, Kristin Lauter, Peter Rindal &amp; Yuhou Xia  ~ <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/207">eprint/2017/207</a> ~ <a href="http://rdcu.be/uvqf">BMC Medical Genomics’17</a> ~ <a href="http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2016/">iDash’16</a></p>

<p>One of the tasks in the iDASH Secure Genome Analysis Competition in 2016 was to demonstrate the feasibility of privacy-preserving queries on homomorphically encrypted genomic data. More precisely, given a list of up to 100,000 mutations, the task was to encrypt the data using homomorphic encryption in a way that allows it to be stored securely in the cloud, and enables the data owner to query the dataset for the presence of specific mutations, without revealing any information about the dataset or the queries to the cloud. We devise a novel string matching protocol that works particularly nicely with homomorphically encrypted data, and show how it yields an efficient solution to the competition task. The protocol we describe is also of independent interest to the homomorphic encryption community, as it can be applied just as well to any kind of data.</p>

<p>Private set intersection (PSI) refers to a special case of secure two-party computation in which the parties each have a set of items and compute the intersection of these sets without revealing any additional information. In this paper we present improvements to practical PSI providing security in the presence of <em>malicious</em> adversaries. Our starting point is the protocol of Dong, Chen &amp; Wen (CCS 2013) that is based on Bloom filters. We identify a bug in their malicious-secure variant and show how to fix it using a cut-and-choose approach that has low overhead while simultaneously avoiding one the main computational bottleneck in their original protocol. We also point out some subtleties that arise when using Bloom filters in malicious-secure cryptographic protocols. We have implemented our PSI protocols and report on its performance. Our improvements reduce the cost of Dong et al.’s protocol by a factor of 14−110× on a single thread. When compared to the previous fastest protocol of De Cristofaro et al., we improve the running time by 8−24×. For instance, our protocol has an online time of 14 seconds and an overall time of 2.1 minutes to securely compute the intersection of two sets of 1 million items each.</p>
