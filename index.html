    I am a Staff Research Scientist at <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html">Visa Research</a> where 
    I work on Cryptography and Secure Computation.  My primary research interest is the development and applications of efficient methods for computing on encrypted data.
    Most notably is the notion of being able to compute on encrypted data and the area of research known as Secure Computation:

<p>I began my career in cryptography at Oregon State University in 2015 with the goal of advancing the field of cryptography to meet real world constraints. Most notably is the notion of being able to compute on encrypted data and the area of research known as Secure Computation:</p>
<p>A group of distrusting parties wish to compute a function on their private data sets. The parties should learn the output of the function but no additional information about the data sets themselves.</p>

<p>The potential of this technology captured my imagination in 2014 during the completion of my undergraduate in Computer Science at Oregon State University. Since then I have worked on several projects in this area. Most notably has been the development of a highly optimized protocol for performing Secure Computation and advances in Private Set Intersection for both malicious and semi-honest adversaries.</p>

<p>I view my research as part of the solution to our most challenging privacy issues. In particular, when strong privacy concerns inhibit the utility of data, e.g. medical data. I am interested in overcoming this tradeoff.</p>

      <h3 id="the-idea">The Idea</h3>

<p>The other day I was reviewing some code when I saw the use of a macro to simplify handling an <code class="highlighter-rouge">error_code</code> like type. I’m sure most of us have seen code like this</p>
<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Either return the error or assign </span>
<span class="c1">// the value type of rexpr to lhs.</span>
<span class="cp">#define ASSIGN_OR_RETURN(lhs, rexpr) ...
</span>
<span class="n">result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">error_code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">...</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">error_code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">ASSIGN_OR_RETURN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">());</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this example <code class="highlighter-rouge">result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> is a discriminated union / sum type, it will either hold the expected type <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code>, or in can of an error it will hold an <code class="highlighter-rouge">E</code>. The macro <code class="highlighter-rouge">ASSIGN_OR_RETURN</code> returns the error type if the error type is active and otherwise assigns the value type to <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>.</p>

<p>I think its pretty obvious why the use of the macro is less than desirable.</p>

<p>We present a scalable database join protocol for secret shared data in the honest majority three party setting. The key features of our protocol are a rich set of SQL-like join/select queries and the ability to compose join operations together due to the inputs and outputs being generically secret shared between the parties. Given that the keys being joined on are unique, no information is revealed to any party during the protocol. In particular, not even the sizes of intermediate joins are revealed. All of our protocols are constant-round and achieve O(n) communication and computation overhead for joining two tables of n</p>

<p>rows.</p>

<p>In addition to performing database joins our protocol, we implement two applications on top of our framework. The first performs joins between different governmental agencies to identify voter registration errors in a privacy-preserving manner. The second application considers the scenario where several organizations wish to compare network security logs to more accurately identify common security threats, e.g. the IP addresses of a bot net. In both, cases the practicality of these applications depends on efficiently performing joins on millions of secret shared records. For example, our three party protocol can perform a join on two sets of 1 million records in 4.9 seconds or, alternatively, compute the cardinality of this join in just 3.1 seconds.</p>

      <p>Elette Boyle, Geoffroy Couteau, Niv Gilboa, Yuval Ishai, Lisa Kohl, Peter Rindal, Peter Scholl ~ <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/706">eprint/2019/706</a> ~ <a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2019/">CCS’19</a></p>

<p>We consider the problem of securely generating useful instances of two-party correlations, such as many independent copies of a random oblivious transfer (OT) correlation, using a small amount of communication. This problem is motivated by the goal of secure computation with silent preprocessing, where a low-communication input-independent setup, followed by local (“silent”) computation, enables a lightweight “non-cryptographic” online phase once the inputs are known.</p>

<p>Recent works of Boyle et al. (CCS 2018, Crypto 2019) achieve this goal with good concrete efficiency for useful kinds of two-party correlations, including OT correlations, under different variants of the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption, and using a small number of “base” oblivious transfers. The protocols of Boyle et al. have several limitations. First, they require a large number of communication rounds. Second, they are only secure against semi-honest parties. Finally, their concrete efficiency estimates are not backed by an actual implementation. In this work we address these limitations, making three main contributions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Eliminating interaction. Under the same assumption, we obtain the first concretely efficient 2-round protocols for generating useful correlations, including OT correlations, in the semi-honest security model. This implies the first efficient 2-round OT extension protocol of any kind and, more generally, protocols for non-interactive secure computation (NISC) that are concretely efficient and have the silent preprocessing feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malicious security. We provide security against malicious parties (in the random oracle model) without additional interaction and with only a modest concrete overhead; prior to our work, no similar protocols were known with any number of rounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implementation. Finally, we implemented, optimized, and benchmarked our 2-round OT extension protocol, demonstrating that it offers a more attractive alternative to the OT extension protocol of Ishai et al. (Crypto 2003) in many realistic settings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Oblivious Transfer has played a crucial role in the design of secure multi party computation. Nevertheless, there are not many practical solutions that achieve simulation based security and at the same time instantiable based on different assumptions.</p>

<p>In this work, we consider a simulation based security notion that we call endemic security. We show how to construct highly efficient oblivious transfer in the random oracle model that achieves endemic security under a wide range of assumptions, among them DDH, CDH, LWE and coding based assumptions. We construct a secure oblivious transfer based on DDH that takes only a single communication round which allows significant performance gains. We also instantiate our oblivious transfer with the Crystals.Kyber key agreement. Our implementation shows that both instantiations can be computed in under one millisecond.</p>

<p>Further, we revisit, correct and improve existing oblivious transfer extension techniques. We provide an implementation of an oblivious transfer extension protocol in the ideal cipher model that is actively secure, processing up to 23 million OTs per second and up to 10 times faster than previous secure implementations. We also show that our framework can compute endemically secure OT extension and the base OTs in just two rounds.</p>

<p>In this work we demonstrate that allowing differentially private leakage can significantly improve the concrete performance of secure 2-party computation (2PC) protocols. Specifically, we focus on the private set intersection (PSI) protocol of Rindal and Rosulek (CCS 2017), which is the fastest PSI protocol with security against malicious participants. We show that if differentially private leakage is allowed, the cost of the protocol can be reduced by up to 63%, depending on the desired level of differential privacy. On the technical side, we introduce a security model for differentially-private leakage in malicious-secure 2PC. We also introduce two new and improved mechanisms for “differentially private histogram overestimates,” the main technical challenge for differentially-private PSI.</p>
